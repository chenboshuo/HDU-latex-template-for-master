I don't want to think about whether I can succeed. Since I have chosen the distance, I only care about the wind and rain.



I don't want to think whether I can win love. Since I am in love with roses, I will bravely express my sincerity.



I don't want to think whether there will be cold wind and cold rain behind me. Since the goal is the horizon, the only thing left to the world is the back.



I don't want to think about whether the future is flat or muddy. As long as I love life, everything is expected.
